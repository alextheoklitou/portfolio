  info: 'Everyone knows the way to win me over is with a good board game.  I own over 30 different ones and at my old work I started a small board games lunch club. Some of my favourites include Sagrada, Mysterium and Settlers of Catan. I also quite enjoy winding down with a good puzzle. These are only a few of the board games I own.',

Here is a picture of all my current records.',

  name: 'Dogs',

Growing up with dogs they are a huge source of joy for me and at the moment, while I can\'t get a dog of my own, I dog sit for my friends whenever they need me to. Here you can see Willow, a black labrador who I look after quite regularly.',
