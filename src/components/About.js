      <p className='p-5 w-1/2'>I am a junior full-stack developer with experience in JavaScript, React, Node, Django and Python. Having recently graduated from General Assembly, I am looking for an opportunity to hone my development skills, while also incorporating some of the skills I have gained in my previous career, working in a students union within the community engagement department. I have wide experience in working with a team, often as a project manager working on training conferences, large scale event planning and volunteer management.</p>
      <p className='px-5 w-1/2'>Working in a students union is something I fell into and was doing until I figured out what I wanted to do. Through my job there I had the opportunity to learn basic HTML so I could start editing some of the pages on our website and that sparked my interest to do some free online courses to expand my knowledge and before I knew it I’d found what I was always looking for. SE perfectly combines the problem solving element that I’m always looking for in a job and my spare time (as I am a huge fan of board games and puzzles) while also managing to remain creative and imaginative, something that has been lacking from my professional life so far.</p>
      <p className='p-5 pb-10 w-1/2'>I believe I have quite a unique background and POV being a queer immigrant with a background in the intersection of charity and higher education work. I am a very detail oriented individual who picks up new skills quickly and easily (something which I have proved during this course so far). I have a good understanding of how to work in a team equally and bring a friendly quality that brings people together working towards the same goal. I am looking for a position as Junior Software Engineer in an inclusive, supportive and friendly organization.</p>
